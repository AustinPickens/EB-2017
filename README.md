Thank you for inquiring more about how the results I presented were conducted in the presentation "Integrating Multi-Omic Data from Proteome, Phospholipidome, and Oxylipid Profiles Explains a Sizable Proportion of Variance Associated with the Presence of Colon Polyps"
  Authors: C. Austin Pickens, Ana I. Vazquez, Lorraine M. Sordillo, A. Daniel Jones, and Jenifer I. Fenton

the statistical code is present in the attached file.

There is a great description of using BGAM models on our collaborator's github: https://github.com/anainesvs/VAZQUEZ_etal_GENETICS_2016

All experimental methods can be found in the attached publications, except the untargeted lipidomic analysis.  We just submited revisions on the manuscript describing the method for the untargeted lipid analysis and this should be published sometime within the next few months in Nature Scientific Reports titled:
  "Obesity, adipokines, and C-peptide are associated with distinct plasma phospholipid profiles in adult males, an untargeted lipidomic       approach" 
      Pickens et al. 2017. Accepted. 
      
In the meantime, I would be happy to describe how this experimental method was conducted.  Please contact me through Research Gate: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Pickens2 or through the email I displayed on the final slide of my presentation.

Samples with shifted chromatography were excluded from the respective data set, which is why in some publications you may see the sample size vary between 123-126, and in the integrative BGAM analysis there were 122 samples.
